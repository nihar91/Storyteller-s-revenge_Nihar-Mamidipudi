# The-Storyteller-s-Revenge

This is a project which depicts the Northern part of India's well known tourist spots spread across Punjab, New Delhi and UttarPradesh

__Introduction__

__Development Process__

I began with downloading the repository videos from Udacity's India repository and as I looked at the footage I decided to make a small teaser film to promote toursim. 

__Conclusion__
I have made a 54 second video in the end and this is the link to the dropbox

It took me almost 2 years to complete the project as I was busy with my day job as a video editor which hardly gave me any time to do this project. The challenges I faced were multifold, firstly, I am not happy with the way this course has been functioning the concepts that I learn are far different from what I have executed in this project file. Secondly, since I have no clue about coding I have lost hours and hours of my precious time figuring out what to do with the code. The only thing I liked about this project was the fact that I got to learn something about making 360 videos.
